Minecraft Classic to 1.15.2 Proxy in C

Many aspects of this are still a WIP, for
example chunk-loading, chat, and improved
error-handling.

Any ideas or contributions are welcome, please
create a Pull Request.

To compile (currently configured for POSIX systems only):
cc *.c -lpthread

The resulting file and config.txt may be moved anywhere and
executed to start a server.
